# Web Development Project 3 - Fish Facts!

Submitted by: Kayla Sison

This web app: allows users to test their fish knowledge with a fun question set, and also learn the material through studying the cards--guessing the answer, checking with the correct one, and shuffling the order of the questions.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card**
- [x] **Clicking on a submit button shows visual feedback about whether the answer was correct or incorrect**
- [x] **A back button is displayed on the card and can be used to return to the previous card in a set sequence**
- [x] **A next button is displayed on the card and can be used to navigate to the next card in a set sequence**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] A shuffle button is used to randomize the order of the cards
- [ ] A user's answer may be counted as correct even when it is slightly different from the target answer
- [ ] A counter displays the user's current and longest streak of correct responses
- [ ] A user can mark a card that they have mastered and have it removed from the pool of answers as well as added to a list of mastered cards

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] "Times studied" count, which counts the amount of times that every card is cycled through

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* I did not have time to implement a flip animation, especially because I would have to refactor my program to better match the resource given for the card flip animation.
